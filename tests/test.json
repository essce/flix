Based on the smash-hit British series of the same name and adapted for American Television by Greg Daniels, this fast-paced comedy parodies contemporary American water-cooler culture. Earnest but clueless regional manager Michael Scott believes himself to be an exceptional boss and mentor, but actually receives more eye-rolls than respect from his oddball staff.</p>","updated":1464823865,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/526"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/711203"}},"_embedded":{"episodes":[{"id":47640,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/47640/the-office-1x01-pilot","name":"Pilot","season":1,"number":1,"airdate":"2005-03-24","airtime":"21:00","airstamp":"2005-03-24T21:00:00-05:00","runtime":30,"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_landscape/49/124795.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/49/124795.jpg"},"summary":"","_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/47640"}}},{"id":47641,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/47641/the-office-1x02-diversity-day","name":"Diversity
